# 📚 DSA Question Collection

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) Question Collection** repository!  

This repository contains a curated set of **DSA problems** that I have collected and solved. It is designed for anyone who wants to **practice and improve their problem-solving skills**, whether for interviews, competitive programming, or learning purposes.  

The repository covers a variety of topics including arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, recursion, and sorting & searching algorithms. Each problem may include my own solution, explanations, or notes that help understand the logic behind it.  

You can **browse through the questions**, try solving them on your own, and then check the provided solutions for guidance. This collection is a work in progress, and I plan to **keep adding more problems** over time.  

Feel free to **use this repository for your learning**, and if you want, you can also contribute by adding new problems or solutions.
